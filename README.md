#HW6 - GIPHY API

https://bfondon.github.io/HW6/

This project is part of homework assignment 6 at the coding bootcamp at UT Austin. The minimum requirements are that the page displays a handful of initial buttons that retrieve 10 gifs related to a topic, along with their rating. There is also user input that can add additional topic buttons that pull 10 more gifs when they are clicked. The gifs are static when they are loaded, and can be clicked on/off to run through their animation.

I would have liked to take the styling a little further, particularly with the gif and rating placement - but time remains a challenge that I have struggled to overcome. I am proud that all of the other functional requirements are there.

HTML, Bootstrap w/ Bootswatch template, and JS/Jquery were all utilized in this project. The GIPHY API was also utilized to pull all gifs and their related data.
